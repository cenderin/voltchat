## Briefing
I only did this so I can mess around with volt, it seems pretty cool(I did use a tutorial for this, but after doing that its so easy to get going I will defiantly add to this or start a new project...).

## Installing it
1. Clone the Repo
2. Install mongodb and start the server using mongod
3. Bundle install where you place the repo
4. bundle exec volt server
5. Watch magic happen.
